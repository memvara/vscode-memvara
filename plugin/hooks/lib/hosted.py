"""Hosted recall over the MCP endpoint, using nothing but the standard library.

This exists so a hosted install needs no `pip install memvara`. The plugin's install story
is "paste a URL", and a hook that silently did nothing until someone also installed a
Python package would be worse than no hook: it fails the same way a working hook over an
empty store looks.

Three things here were found by measurement rather than reasoning, and each one is a
silent failure if you skip it.

**Set a User-Agent.** Cloudflare rejects the default `Python-urllib/3.13` with error 1010
before the request reaches the application at all. Measured side by side: the stock agent
gets 403/1010, and `curl/8.7.1`, a browser string and `memvara-hook/0.1` all get through to
a genuine 401. Nothing in that 403 hints that the client's name is the problem.

**Bring a CA bundle.** python.org's macOS build does not use the system trust store, so
verification fails with CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED on a certificate every other tool on the
machine accepts. `certifi` is used when present and the default context otherwise.

**Use `http.client`, not `urllib`.** `urlopen` builds a fresh connection per call, which
throws away the TLS handshake every prompt — about 170ms of the ~390ms a cold request
costs. `HTTPSConnection` is the stdlib object that can be held open, and holding it is the
entire reason the daemon pays for itself on a hosted install: ~390ms cold against
~162-287ms warm.

**Reads raise, and that is a reversal.** They used to answer `None` on any failure, on the
argument that a prompt without a memory block beats a prompt with an error in it. That rule
is still right, but it belongs in the *hook*, not here: collapsing failure into the same
value as "nothing relevant" is what let a dead client look like an empty store for thirty
minutes at a time. See `HostedError` and `daemon.Daemon._answer` — the caller decides what a
failure costs, and it can only decide if it is told.

    different questions. A caller that cannot tell them apart reports an unreachable store
    as an empty one, which is the failure this file spent thirty minutes at a time
    demonstrating.

    `status` is the HTTP status of the refusal. It is 200 when the server answered the call
    and the tool itself refused it (a JSON-RPC error or a result with `isError`), and `None`
    when nothing came back at all. Only a refusal with status 200 can be about an argument:
    a 429, a 402 or a 5xx is decided before the tool reads its arguments.

    `code` and `detail` carry the server's own account of the refusal when it sent one.
    They were thrown away until a quota-exhausted account spent a day reporting "recall
    failed -- see capture.log": the server had said which allowance, how much of it, and
    when it resets, and every word was discarded one frame below the banner that needed
    it. `code` is the machine token (`quota_exhausted`); `detail` is the object beside it.
    Both are **empty rather than `None`** when the failure was transport-level and there
    was nothing to read -- `code` is `""` and `detail` is `{}`, so a caller tests
    truthiness and never identity. An earlier draft of this docstring said `None`, which

        plan's allowance, which is why a known schema never comes here.

        Optional arguments are dropped one at a time, cumulatively, in the order that loses

#: than a bare singleton so a credentials file that legitimately names two different
#: projects mid-process -- unlikely, but cheap to get right -- still gets two clients
#: rather than one wrongly shared between them.
#:
#: `recall.py` can reach `open_hosted()` from up to three places in a single invocation:
#: `fast.recall()`'s main pass, its episode-widening retry, and `_standing_refresh()`'s own
#: `open_writer()`. A fresh `HostedRecall` per call meant a fresh `_ensure_session()`
#: handshake per call -- a full `_rpc()` round trip with its own one retry -- so a hook that
#: reached this three times paid for the handshake three times before any of the three tool
#: calls it actually wanted even started. `close()` clears `_conn` but never `_session` (see
#: `HostedRecall.close`), so a cached instance's session survives a caller closing it after
#: its own use; the only round trip `_ensure_session()` ever needed happens once per process
#: instead of once per call.
#:
#: `daemon.py` calls this exactly once, at startup, and holds the result for the process's
#: whole life -- caching changes nothing there. The win is entirely in the short-lived hook
#: processes that used to rebuild the handshake on every call within their one invocation.
