"""The on/off switches for optional hook features.

Every feature a user can turn off during `/memvara:setup` is read here. The switches live in
`~/.memvara/settings.json`, a flat JSON object of `feature_name: true|false`. A missing key
means the feature's default, which is `FEATURE_DEFAULTS` below: on for every feature except
`extraction_chunks` and `agentic_extraction`.

The file holds one entry that is not a switch. `/memvara:setup verify-key` records its test
call to the read-path model under the key `read_model`, and `lib.read_model` reads it back
through `stored()`.

An environment variable `MEMVARA_FEATURE_<NAME>=0|1` overrides the file, so a test or a CI
run can pin a value without writing to the user's home directory. The library's MCP server
reads the same variable names in `ServerConfig.from_env`, so one variable means the same
thing on both sides.

The file is read at most once per process. A hook process lives for one event, so a switch
changed during a session still takes effect on the next prompt. The long-lived recall daemon
does not read switches at all; the hook that spawns it does.
