"""Cursor, as a `Host` record. A REDUCED port, and the reduction is the headline.

Measured against cursor-agent 2026.08.25-3e8eec8 on 2026-09-01 with a throwaway probe
registering every event Cursor's own bundle names.

**There is no per-prompt recall on this host, so `recall` is absent from `events`.**
`beforeSubmitPrompt` is the event that would carry it, and it never fires: not on the
first message, not on a `--continue` follow-up, and not from user scope or project scope.
Cursor's source declares it and its editor may drive it over a separate RPC path, but the
CLI does not, and a record that mapped `recall` to it would produce a hook that installs,
registers and never runs. `run.py` skips a canonical hook the record has no event for and
says so in the log, which is the honest shape for a host that cannot do something.

What DOES work, all confirmed by delivery -- the model read the injected marker back:

* `sessionStart` carries the standing block.
* `preToolUse` auto-approves, and can carry context too.
* `sessionEnd` is the only turn-ish event that fires with a transcript, so capture runs
  ONCE at the end of a session rather than once a turn. `stop` is declared by Cursor and
  never fired in any probe.

**Nothing this plugin says reaches the person.** A reply's `systemMessage` was emitted
alongside the context and never appeared; so were `message` and `userMessage`. Only
`additional_context` was delivered, so `status_key` is empty and `~/.memvara/.hooks/` is
the whole account of itself this host has.

**A carrier cap that DROPS rather than truncates.** Over 10,000 characters the tool-event
carrier discards the whole block and logs `additional_context exceeded max size; dropping
carrier` -- measured, `preToolUse` delivered at 9,000 chars and returned neither nonce at
20,000. `sessionStart` is not carried that way and passed 20,000 intact, which is why the
standing block is safe on the event that actually carries it.
