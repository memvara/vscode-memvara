"""What one coding host's hook I/O looks like, written down as data.

Every hook body in this package used to spell Claude Code's protocol inline: the stdin
key a session id arrives under, the reply key a status line has to be printed against,
the tag a machine-generated prompt is wrapped in. Six sibling plugin repos are about to
vendor these same bodies for six other hosts, and a literal repeated in seven places
fails the way this repository's CLAUDE.md describes at length -- by doing nothing, in a
copy nobody is reading. So the literals move here, one `Host` record per client, and the
bodies read them.

**The record says what a host cannot do, not only what it does.** A canonical hook name
absent from `events` is a hook that host has no event for; `context_key = ""` is a host
with no per-turn injection channel at all; `transcript = None` is a host where capture
cannot run. Those are the states a port gets wrong, and an absent key is the one spelling
that cannot be mistaken for a working default.

`collections.namedtuple` rather than `typing.NamedTuple`, and that is a cost decision
rather than a style one: `typing` is not otherwise imported anywhere on the per-prompt
path and costs 3-5ms measured to import, against a client budget of ~30ms. This
repository already refuses `pathlib` there for 10.5ms. `collections` is already loaded by
the time any hook runs, so this is free. Field names are exactly what the class-syntax
version would have had.

from collections import namedtuple

#: One hook invocation, in the shape the bodies read. `raw` is the undecoded stdin object,
#: kept so a body can reach a field no host record has been taught yet -- and so that a
#: reader debugging a port can see what actually arrived rather than what we extracted.
Event = namedtuple(
    "Event",
    "hook session cwd prompt transcript_path tool_name reentrant raw",
)

#: One hook's answer, before any host has been asked how to spell it. `status` is the line
#: a person at the terminal sees; `context` is text put in front of the model;
#: `decision`/`reason` are the permission verdict a pre-tool event carries. Empty means
#: "this reply does not carry that", which is not the same as a host that cannot carry it
#: -- `Host.status_key` and `Host.context_key` decide that, and they decide it once.
Reply = namedtuple("Reply", "hook status context decision reason",
                   defaults=("", "", "", ""))

#: How a host keeps the conversation on disk, and therefore whether `capture` can mine it.
#: Presence is the capability flag: `Host.transcript = None` means this host does not hand
#: a hook anything to read back, so the Stop-equivalent body must not run at all.
#: `role_key` is the entry key that says who is speaking. Claude Code and OpenCode put it
#: under `type`; Cursor writes the same `message.content` blocks under `role`. One field
#: rather than a third reader, because that is the whole difference between them -- and a
#: host that differs in KIND rather than in spelling gets a `format` of its own instead,
#: as Codex does.
TranscriptSpec = namedtuple("TranscriptSpec", "format role_key", defaults=("type",))

#: Everything the pre-tool auto-approve needs that differs by host. Deliberately NOT the
#: read-only tool list: which memory_* tools are safe to run unprompted is a fact about
#: our own MCP server, identical everywhere, and duplicating it per host would let one
#: copy start approving a forget.
ApproveSpec = namedtuple("ApproveSpec", "matcher separators decision_key reason_key allow")

#: The headless CLI `capture` shells out to in order to mine a turn: the command without
#: the prompt, which is appended, plus where to read the answer out of the envelope it
#: prints. The recursion sentinel is deliberately absent -- that environment variable is
#: ours, identical on every host, and lives in `lib.ipc` for the same reason `READ_ONLY`
#: and `RECALL_MARKERS` do.
#:
#: The three keys travel together because they describe one thing: the JSON object one
#: CLI prints in its `--output-format json` mode. `reply_key` holds what the model said,
#: `usage_key` what it cost, and `error_key` the flag that turns an exit-0 run into a
#: failure. Splitting them -- two on the record and one still spelled inline in
#: `lib/extract.py` -- would mean a port that got its reply key right could still read
#: every error as a success, which stores nothing and reports nothing.
#: How to read a reply out of a CLI that prints a JSONL EVENT STREAM rather than one
#: envelope object. `claude -p --output-format json` prints a single object and needs
#: none of this; `codex exec --json` and `opencode run --format json` both print a line
#: per event, so the reply has to be selected out of the stream instead of looked up.
#:
#: `reply_match` is a tuple of `(dotted key, expected value)` pairs that must ALL hold for
#: a line to be part of the reply, and `reply_path` is where the text sits in that line.
#: Every matching line is concatenated, because a host may stream one text part per chunk.
#: `usage_match`/`usage_path` are the same for the accounting line.
#:
#: Declarative on purpose. The alternative was a parser per host, which is the shape this
#: package moved everything else away from -- a host difference belongs in the record.
StreamSpec = namedtuple("StreamSpec", "reply_match reply_path usage_match usage_path")

#: `stream` is None for a CLI that prints one JSON object, in which case `reply_key`,
#: `usage_key` and `error_key` are read from it. When `stream` is present those three are
#: unused and the `StreamSpec` decides everything.
#: `model` is the model this argv PINS, or "" when the CLI mines with whatever the user
#: has configured. It exists because `usage.jsonl` records what a run cost against a model
#: name, and that name has to be the one actually invoked. While every host shelled out to
#: `claude -p` a single constant was correct; now that a host mines with its own CLI, a
#: hardcoded label would record spend against a model that never ran -- wrong in the one
#: file whose whole job is to say what was spent. An empty string is recorded as the
#: program name, which is true and checkable, rather than a guess at the user's default.
ExtractorSpec = namedtuple(
    "ExtractorSpec", "argv reply_key usage_key error_key stream model",
    defaults=(None, ""))

#: The model `claude -p` is asked for. Named once because it is spelled twice: in the
#: argv below, and as the label `lib.extract` writes to `usage.jsonl`. Two spellings
#: would let the ledger name a model that was never invoked, which is wrong in the one
#: file that exists to say what was spent.

#: Codex's own headless CLI, measured on codex-cli 0.151.0. `codex exec --json` prints
#: `{"type": "item.completed", "item": {"type": "agent_message", "text": ...}}` for the
#: reply and `{"type": "turn.completed", "usage": {...}}` for the cost.
#:
#: `--skip-git-repo-check` because the extractor runs wherever the turn happened, which
#: is frequently not a repository, and Codex refuses outside one without it.

#: OpenCode's own, measured on opencode 1.18.20. `opencode run --format json` prints
#: `{"type": "text", "part": {"text": ...}}` for the reply and
#: `{"type": "step_finish", "part": {"tokens": {...}}}` for the cost.
#:
#: No `--model`: the point of a host-native extractor is that it mines the turn with the
#: model that user already chose and pays for. Naming one here would override their
#: configuration from inside a hook they did not read.
OPENCODE_CLI = ExtractorSpec(

        usage_path="part.tokens",
    ),
)

#: Cursor's own headless CLI, measured on cursor-agent 2026.08.25. It prints a SINGLE
#: envelope rather than an event stream -- `result`, `usage`, `is_error` -- which is the
#: same shape `claude -p` prints, so this needs no `StreamSpec`.
#:
#: `--mode ask` is not a preference. `-p` alone "has access to all tools, including write
#: and shell", and what this command is handed is a mined turn: arbitrary text, including
#: anything the user pasted into their session. Read-only mode is what makes the `--trust`
#: beside it defensible -- and `--trust` is required, not optional, because an extraction
#: runs wherever the turn happened and Cursor refuses an untrusted directory outright.
#: Granting trust to a command that can only read is a different act from granting it to
#: one that can run shell.
CURSOR_CLI = ExtractorSpec(
    argv=("cursor-agent", "--trust", "--mode", "ask", "-p", "--output-format", "json"),
    reply_key="result",
    usage_key="usage",
    error_key="is_error",
)

#: GitHub Copilot CLI's own headless mode, measured on 1.0.82. `copilot --output-format
#: json -p <prompt>` prints a JSONL event stream, so this needs a `StreamSpec` the way
#: Codex and OpenCode do: the reply arrives as `{"type": "assistant.message", "data":
#: {"content": ...}}` and the cost as a single closing `{"type": "result", "usage": ...}`.
#:
#: A turn may produce several `assistant.message` lines, one per model call, and every
#: matching line is concatenated -- which is what we want, because the mined text is one
#: answer split across calls rather than several answers.
#:
#: `-p` is LAST because `lib.extract` appends the prompt as the final argument and `-p`
#: takes it as its value. An argv that ended anywhere else would hand Copilot a stray
#: positional and the prompt would never be asked.
#:
#: **`--available-tools` is a safety guard, not a preference, and its value is deliberately
#: a name no tool has.** Measured: `copilot -p` executes tools WITHOUT `--allow-all-tools`
#: -- a probe told to run a shell command ran it -- so an extractor left at the default
#: hands arbitrary mined text, including anything the user pasted into their session, to a
#: model that can act on it. `--available-tools=` with an empty value does not restrict
#: (the same probe still ran bash), `--excluded-tools=bash` left `read_bash`/`list_bash`
#: behind, and `--deny-tool=shell` did not stop `bash`. An allowlist naming nothing real
#: is the one form measured to grant zero tools, and the string says why it is there. If a
#: later Copilot rejects an unknown tool name outright, extraction fails loudly and is
#: logged, which is the safe direction for this particular guard to break in.
#:
#: `--no-custom-instructions` keeps the child from reading a repository's AGENTS.md into a
#: job that is only meant to read one turn back.
#:
#: The two MCP flags are one thought and both are needed. `--disable-builtin-mcps` covers
#: only GitHub's; a user's own servers still connect, and the one this plugin itself
#: installs is Memvara's hosted endpoint -- so without the second flag every mined turn
#: opened an authenticated connection to `app.memvara.dev` that the tool allowlist above
#: had already made unreachable. Measured on a `copilot -p` run: a server handshake takes
#: ~2.6s before the first model call, paid on every capture, for tools that cannot be
#: called. The name is the key this plugin's `.mcp.json` uses; naming one that is not
#: configured is harmless -- the run reports it `disabled` and answers normally.
COPILOT_CLI = ExtractorSpec(
    argv=("copilot", "--available-tools=memvara-extract-grants-no-tools",
          "--disable-builtin-mcps", "--disable-mcp-server", "memvara",
          "--no-custom-instructions", "--no-color",
          "--output-format", "json", "-p"),

        reply_path="data.content",
        usage_match=(("type", "result"),),
        usage_path="usage",
    ),
)

#: One consequence of mining with the user's own model, recorded because it is a real
#: trade and not a free win: extraction latency and quality become theirs. Measured on
#: 2026-09-01 against a free OpenRouter model configured in OpenCode, one run exceeded
#: `extract.TIMEOUT_SEC` and logged "no reply within 90s" before a retry succeeded, and
#: the reply came back conversational where `claude -p` returns the terse list the prompt
#: asks for. Both are handled -- a timeout is a logged failure that raises the capture
#: alert, and a reply the parser cannot use stores nothing rather than storing junk -- but
#: a user on a slow or small model will see capture fail more often than one on Claude
#: Code, and the log is where they will see it.

#: The second rung of the extractor chain, available to every host rather than only to
#: the one that packages Claude Code.
#:
#: It lives in `core/` -- the half of this tree that is the same bytes in every plugin
#: repository -- because it is a fact about one CLI product and not about any host. A
#: Codex or Cursor user with Claude Code also installed can mine turns with it, and the
#: `hosts/codex.py` in that repository must not have to carry a copy of this argv to say
#: so. `hosts/claude.py` names this record as its own extractor rather than restating it,
#: so the `--settings` guard below is the only spelling of that flag anywhere.
#:
#: `--settings '{"hooks":{}}'` clears the hooks a settings file declares. It does NOT
#: clear the ones a plugin registers -- measured, with a marker file: the child still
#: fires this plugin's own SessionStart and UserPromptSubmit. So it is one of two guards
#: against recursion and not the load-bearing one; the sentinel in `lib.ipc` is what
#: actually stops it, and `ipc.under_extraction` is what stands the read hooks down. Kept
#: because a settings-declared Stop hook is a real way in.

#: Two fields that both sound like "capture must not block" and are NOT the same fact,
#: separated because one host has one and not the other.
#:
#: `supports_async` says the client will run the capture hook asynchronously if the
#: registration asks it to. `detach_capture` says this host's capture hook has to detach
#: ITSELF -- `run.py` re-execs into a new session and returns immediately.
#:
#: Codex is why they are two. Its registration schema accepts `async: true` and its
#: documentation offers it, but an async hook there does not run AT ALL: measured on
#: codex-cli 0.151.0, an async Stop hook wrote no receipt even though writing one is the
#: first statement in the script. The same hook declared synchronous fires, and a child it
#: spawns with `start_new_session=True` OUTLIVES the `codex exec` process and finishes
#: twelve seconds after the turn ended. So Codex is `supports_async=False` -- asking for
#: async would silently disable capture -- and `detach_capture=True`.
#:
#: A host may have neither (capture blocks, and must be short), one, or in principle both.
#: Nothing infers one from the other, because "the client honours the flag" and "we fork"
#: fail in opposite directions: guessing the first wrong loses the hook, guessing the
#: second wrong holds the turn open for the whole extraction.

#: Canonical hook names. The bodies and `run.py` speak these; `Host.events` maps each to
#: whatever the host calls the event it fires.
