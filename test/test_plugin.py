        permission the organization pins, nothing here going red, and the agreement
        between the two stale files being the thing that hid it.

        Two deliberate choices about noise. It compares BYTES rather than shas, so the
        library moving does not fail this repository -- only the library's *skill* moving
        does, which is rare. And it compares the file SET as well, because a new reference
        file upstream is drift that a per-file comparison of the files we already have
        would never see.

        it could not look is the failure it exists to prevent, one level up.
